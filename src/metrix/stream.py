class MStream:
    """
    A stream of :class:`MElement` s that groups elements into batches of fixed
    time or number, further groups batches by distinct assigned tags, then aggregates
    each group's values by one or multiple functions.

    To do any useful work, metric streams must be connected to an ``MSink``, which
    operates on elements in a visible / persistent way. In typical usage, you'll want
    to connect multiple streams to multiple sinks using a ``MCoordinator``.
    Refer to that class for a more realistic usage example than what follows here:

    .. code-block:: pycon

       >>> from metrix import MElement, MStream
       >>> eles = [{"value": 1}, {"value": 2}, {"value": 1, "tags": {"foo": "bar"}}]
       >>> mstream = MStream("m", agg=sum, default_tags={"foo": "BAR!"}, window_size=1)
       >>> # HACK! we'll add a sink directly so we can see what happens
       >>> mstream.stream.sink(print)
       >>> for ele in eles:
       ...     mstream.send(**ele)
       MElement(name=m.sum, value=3, tags={'foo': 'BAR!'})
       MElement(name=m.sum, value=1, tags={'foo': 'bar'})

    Args:
        name: Name of the metric whose elements are sent into this stream.
        agg: One or multiple aggregation functions to be applied to groups of metric
            elements' values in order to produce new, aggregated metric elements.
            This may be specified as a single callable or a sequence of callables,
            in which case the corresponding components of the :attr:`MStream.stream`
            are named after the functions themselves; this may also be specified
            as a mapping of component name to callable, in which case the user-specified
            names are used instead.
        default_tags: Optional set of tags to apply to all metric elements by default.
            Tags specified on individual elements override and append to this def
        window_size: Size of tumbling window in *seconds* with which to group elements.
            For example: If ``window_size=10``, all elements sent into the stream
            within a given 10-second window will be grouped together before
            their values are aggregated, as specified by ``agg``.
        batch_size: Size of batches in *number of elements* with which to group elements.
            For example: If ``batch_size=10``, every 10 successive elements sent into
            the stream will be grouped together before their values are aggregated,
            as specified by ``agg``. Note that setting ``batch_size=1`` will effectively
            skip grouping, in which case aggregating values doesn't make sense, either.

    Note:
        You *must* set either ``window_size`` or ``batch_size`` when initializing
        a metric stream. No default is set because it depends entirely on context:
        the rate with which metric elements are sent into the stream, the desired
        resolution on aggregated metrics, and any rate limit requirements on connected
        metric sinks. This is the only stream attribute that demands deliberate thought.
        Choose wisely! :)
